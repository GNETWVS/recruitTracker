% Part I - Image subtraction
%
% The user to points to the white, ambient, and flourescent images,
% (which are processed using dcraw from raw images as described in the paper).
%
%
% Ask the user to specify the path of the white image
[white_im_name,white_im_path] = uigetfile('*.png','Please select the white image.');
% Ask the user to specify the path of the ambient image
[amb_im_name,amb_im_path] = uigetfile('*.png','Please select the ambient image.');
% Ask the user to specify the path of the fluorescent image
[fluo_im_name,fluo_im_path] = uigetfile('*.png','Please select the fluorescent image.');

tic
% Perform the image subtraction and registration
[Isubtracted, ~] = rT_mergeTrioPair([amb_im_path,amb_im_name],[white_im_path,white_im_name],[fluo_im_path,fluo_im_name]);

title('Result of Image Subtraction')

% Subtraction is a computationally expensive operation and takes a long
% time. Thus after every run, we save the subtracted image.

% On a 2.5 GHz intel core i7 laptop,
% If the input image is size 1534 x 1024, subtraction takes 4.4 seconds.
% If the input image is size 4912 x 7360, subtraction takes up to 10 minutes.
% Even though for large images the computation time is long, we do not recommend 
% downsampling the images because recruits are small, and
% might lose saliency if the image is downsampled.

% file name for the subtracted image to be saved
saveName = 'subtractedImage';
rT_writeFig(saveName)
% Also save a mat file.
save([saveName,'.mat'],'Isubtracted')

% Part II - GUI to guide user to mark corals
%
% First, some parameters:

% pix2cm:       conversion from pixels to absolute length (cm).
%
                % This can be specified by the user manually, or be automatically
                % extracted from each image using our code. However, the automatic
                % extraction code is customized to work for our dataset ONLY, which
                % contains a flourescent rope that has markings every 1cm. If your scale
                % object is different, this code will not work for you. In that case, you
                % should measure
                
% Manual Entry
pix2cm = 50; % This is a value that works for the example dataset we have provided.

% Automatic Calculation: uncomment the line below if you want the code to
% calculate it for each image for OUR dataset.

                
% cmThreshold:  Size range of major diameter of corals, outside of which they will be eliminated
                % Adjust as needed. If you are not looking for recruits,
                % you can specify a much wider range.

                cmThreshold = [0.1 2.5];

% c:            an rgb-lab color transform
                % This 
c = makecform('srgb2lab');

% output file name that will be saved in folder "outputFileName"
outputFileName = 'coralData.txt';

% Start the coral tracking program
rT_recruitTracker(Isubtracted,outputFileName,cmThreshold,c);
